"""Base classes for forced measurement plugins and the driver task for these.

In forced measurement, a reference catalog is used to define restricted measurements (usually just fluxes)
on an image.  As the reference catalog may be deeper than the detection limit of the measurement image, we
do not assume that we can use detection and deblend information from the measurement image.  Instead, we
assume this information is present in the reference catalog and can be "transformed" in some sense to
the measurement frame.  At the very least, this means that Footprints from the reference catalog should
be transformed and installed as Footprints in the output measurement catalog.  If we have a procedure that
can transform HeavyFootprints, we can then proceed with measurement as usual, but using the reference
catalog's id and parent fields to define deblend families.  If this transformation does not preserve
HeavyFootprints (this is currently the case, at least for CCD forced photometry), then we will only
be able to replace objects with noise one deblend family at a time, and hence measurements run in
single-object mode may be contaminated by neighbors when run on objects with parent != 0.

Measurements are generally recorded in the coordinate system of the image being measured (and all
slot-eligible fields must be), but non-slot fields may be recorded in other coordinate systems if necessary
to avoid information loss (this should, of course, be indicated in the field documentation).  Note that
the reference catalog may be in a different coordinate system; it is the responsibility of plugins
to transform the data they need themselves, using the reference WCS provided.  However, for plugins
that only require a position or shape, they may simply use output SourceCatalog's centroid or shape slots,
which will generally be set to the transformed position of the reference object before any other plugins are
run, and hence avoid using the reference catalog at all.

Command-line driver tasks for forced measurement can be found in forcedPhotImage.py, including
ForcedPhotImageTask, ForcedPhotCcdTask, and ForcedPhotCoaddTask.

    \anchor ForcedMeasurementTask_

    \brief A subtask for measuring the properties of sources on a single
    exposure, using an existing "reference" catalog to constrain some aspects
    of the measurement.

    The task is configured with a list of "plugins": each plugin defines the values it
    measures (i.e. the columns in a table it will fill) and conducts that measurement
    on each detected source (see ForcedPlugin).  The job of the
    measurement task is to initialize the set of plugins (which includes setting up the
    catalog schema) from their configuration, and then invoke each plugin on each
    source.

    Most of the time, ForcedMeasurementTask will be used via one of the subclasses of
    ForcedPhotImageTask, ForcedPhotCcdTask and ForcedPhotCoaddTask.  These combine
    this measurement subtask with a "references" subtask (see BaseReferencesTask and
    CoaddSrcReferencesTask) to perform forced measurement using measurements performed on
    another image as the references.  There is generally little reason to use
    ForcedMeasurementTask outside of one of these drivers, unless it is necessary to avoid
    using the Butler for I/O.

    ForcedMeasurementTask has only three methods: __init__(), run(), and generateMeasCat().
    For configuration options, see SingleFrameMeasurementConfig.

         - generateMeasCat() must be called to create the output measCat argument.
         - Footprints appropriate for the forced sources must be attached to the measCat records.  The
           attachTransformedFootprints() method can be used to do this, but this degrades HeavyFootprints
           to regular Footprints, leading to non-deblended measurement, so most callers should provide
           Footprints some other way.  Typically, calling code will have access to information that will
           allow them to provide HeavyFootprints - for instance, ForcedPhotCoaddTask uses the HeavyFootprints
           from deblending run in the same band just before non-forced is run measurement in that band.
